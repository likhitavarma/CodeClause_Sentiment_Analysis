# Sentiment Analysis
This project involves performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of reviews to determine the polarity of the sentiment as either positive or negative. The project uses Python and R, and the dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle. The steps involved in the project are as follows:

Load the dataset
Preprocess the data (clean and tokenize the text)
Split the data into training and testing sets
Vectorize the data (convert text data to numerical form)
Train a machine learning model on the training data
Evaluate the model on the testing data
Use the model to predict the sentiment of new reviews
